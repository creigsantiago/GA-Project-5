This Project will focus on Predicting the gubenatorial election in California

Problem Statement:

WAM News is trying to develop an accurate model that predicts the gubernatorial election in California. Using the CCEC Dataset from Harvard University, we would like to build a classification model to accurately classify and predict Californiaâ€™s gubernatorial preferences. The model will be evaluated based on accuracy, specificity, and recall with the goal of trying to get accuracy above null hypothesis.
